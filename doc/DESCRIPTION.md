A greatly enhanced fork of Misskey with better UI/UX, security, features, and more!


    Firefish is based off of Misskey, a powerful microblogging server on ActivityPub with features such as emoji reactions, a customizable web UI, rich chatting, and much more!
    Firefish adds many quality of life changes and bug fixes for users and instance admins alike.

### üõë FIREFISH REACHED END OF LIFE üõë ###

As [announced](https://lm.korako.me/post/91660) Firefish reached end of life at the end of 2024, now it's [homepage](https://firefish.dev) is blank, code repo is gone and the app is no longer installable.
Move to [alternatives](https://apps.yunohost.org/catalog?category=social_media) ASAP!

### ‚ö†Ô∏è PLEASE READ CAREFULLY ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Firefish** requires **redis** version **7**, but YunoHost does not currently support this version.
Some functions will not be available if you install this package.

I advise you to wait for the release of _Bookworm_ Debian 12.
