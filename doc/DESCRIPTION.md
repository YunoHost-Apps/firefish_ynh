A greatly enhanced fork of Misskey with better UI/UX, security, features, and more! https://joinfirefish.org/


    Firefish is based off of Misskey, a powerful microblogging server on ActivityPub with features such as emoji reactions, a customizable web UI, rich chatting, and much more!
    Firefish adds many quality of life changes and bug fixes for users and instance admins alike.

### ⚠️ PLEASE READ CAREFULLY ⚠️

**Firefish** requires **redis** version **7**, but YunoHost does not currently support this version.
Some functions will not be available if you install this package.

I advise you to wait for the release of _Bookworm_ Debian 12.
